# Karamoja-Crop-Data-Analysis-project.
PROJECT OVERVIEW.

Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks. Karamoja (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

In Karamoja, several NGOs provide technical support as well as farm inputs to the farmers experiencing extremely low yield. Though, they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often need to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities.
Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) has been requested to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.

To do so, Dalberg Data Insights developed a methodology to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize) based on satellite images. The agri-tech team just ran the model for the 2017 crop season.

Research Question

As a Data Analyst, the agri-tech team is asking you to develop an interactive visualization tool of the results for this first crop season. This visualization tool that you will develop will be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring tool that DDI will develop for the NGO.
Based on your experience, the team expects you to come up with a first draft within the coming 3 working days. They give you carte blanche in terms of structure and functionalities but they know that the client wants:

-At least a map in the dashboard

-The possibility of visualizing the results by district or sub-county (two administrative levels used by the NGO)

Dataset Files

Dataset Source [Link]Links to an external site.
-Shapefiles
-Boundaries of Uganda Subcounties
-Boundaries of Uganda Districts
-Crop Type Map for Sorghum (i.e. position of the Sorghum fields)
-Crop Type Map for Maize
-Tables
-Yield and Population per Subcounty
-POP: total population for the subcounty
-S_Yield_Ha: average yield for sorghum for the subcounty (Kg/Ha)
-M_Yield_Ha: average yield for maize for the subcounty (Kg/Ha)
-Crop_Area_Ha: total crop area for the subcounty (Ha)
-S_Area_Ha: total sorghum crop area for the subcounty (Ha)
-M_Area_Ha: total maize crop area for the subcounty (Ha)
-S_Prod_Tot: total productivity for the sorghum for the subcounty (Kg)
-M_Prod_Tot: total productivity for the maize for the subcounty (Kg)
-Yield and Population per District

Objectives.

To identify the population distribution in each district and subcounty.

To identify which districts were highly productive in their production of Maize and Sorghum

To identify which District yielded the highest and lowest Maize and Sorghum in the region

Conclusion.

From the population distribution we can identify that Kaabong district received the highest population Distribution while the least was the Abim district.

From the data we can conclude Kotido had the highest productin of Maize while Amudat had the least while Nakapiripirit had the highest Maize production and Moroto the lowest maize production

From the data we can conclude that Kaabong had the highest sorghum yield while Moroto had the lowest yield while Kaabong had the highest maize yield and Amudat faced the lowest maize yields.

RECOMMENDATIONS.

We recommend that increased Sorghum production should be practised in Kaabong district as they have the highest population. This will help curb any food insecurity issues as they have the highest population presence.

Increased production should be done in Moroto as they have low productions but produce high yields we can conclude that more production will lead to greater yields.

Kotido subcounty should receive improved farming technologies too help curb their very high production and very low yields.
